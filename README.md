## Features
* Search a summoner from any region and pull data about their ranked games.
* View which players you have duoed with the most along with your winrates with them
* Check your overall winrate with and without a duo partner.
* Analyze your winrate when on a loss-streak (1, 2, 3, and 4 game losing streaks).
* Bot's status message indicates whether or not it is handling a different request (Riot limits the speed at which you can search matches).

* !duolosers region summonerName (!duolosers na albert471)

* !duo help

  * First rift herald percentage
* And more ideas in the works
