**DuoBot is a discord bot that allows users to see in-depth information regarding their ranked performance this season.**

Specifically, it allows people to see their League of Legends winrate with and without a duo in addition to whether they have been affected by the so-called "loser's queue".

* Compare stats in your solo/duo games, flex games, or both
* Calculate your overall winrate with and without a duo partner.
* Analyze your winrate when on a loss-streak (1, 2, 3, and 4 game losing streaks).
* Check your longest ranked losing streak in the current season.
* View your winrate at different game length intervals (sub20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 35-40, over 40)

* Compare ranked winrate by time of day.
* Track improvement through the following metrics:
  * Vision score
  * CS at 10, 15, 20 minutes
  * First tower percentage
  * First dragon percentage
  * First rift herald percentage
* And more ideas in the works
